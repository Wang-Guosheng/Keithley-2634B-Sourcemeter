* resistor networks and hybrid devices in cases where internal resistance connection nodes are not accessible
* combination of 4-wire Kelvin connections and guarded ohms features eliminates the effects of internal parallel resistances that could degrade measurement accuracy and reduce measurement speed. 

*NOTE: See Figure 2-5C for 6-wire ohms connections. See also Section 2, “Ohms  guard,” and Section 6, “Guard.”*

1. Press CONFIG then Ω to display the CONFIG OHMS menu.
2. Select SENSE MODE, then press ENTER.
3. Select 4-WIRE, then press ENTER.
4. From the CONFIG OHMS menu, select GUARD, then press ENTER.
5. Select OHMS, then press ENTER.
6. Press EXIT to return to normal display.
7. Press MEAS then Ω to select the ohms measurement function.
8. Select the appropriate measurement range, or use autoranging if desired.
9. Turn on the output by pressing the ON/OFF OUTPUT key.
10. Take readings from the display.
11. Turn the output off when done by pressing the ON/OFF OUTPUT key.

### Remote ohms programming
#### Basic remote ohms commands

Table 4-2: Remote commands for basic ohms measurements
|Command| Description|
| ---- | ---- |
|`:SENSe:FUNCtion “RESistance”`|Select ohms function.|
|`:SENSe:RESistance:RANGe <n>`|Select ohms range (n = range).|
|`:SENSe:RESistance:MODE <name>`|Select ohms mode (name = MANual or AUTO).|
|`:SENSe:RESistance:OCOMpensated <state>`|Enable/disable offset compensation (state = ON or OFF).|
|`:SENSe:VOLTage:PROTection <n>`|Set voltage compliance n for manual ohms.|
|`:SENSe:CURRent:PROTection <n>`|Set current compliance n for manual ohms.|
|`:SOURce:FUNCtion <name>`|Select source function (name = VOLTage or CURRent).|
|`:SYSTem:RSENse <state>`|2-wire/4-wire sensing (state = ON, 4-wire; OFF, 2-wire).|
|`:OUTPut <state>`|Turn output on or off (state = ON or OFF).|
|`:READ?`|Trigger and acquire reading.|

See Section 18 for more details on these commands.

#### Ohms programming example
Table 4-3 summarizes the command sequence for a typical auto ohms measurement.
These commands set up the SourceMeter as follows:
* Ohms mode and range: auto, 20kΩ
* Offset compensation: off
* Sense mode: 4-wire

Table 4-3: Auto ohms programming example[^note]
|    Step  |   Action   |   Command   |   Description   |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
|      |      |  `*RST`    |  Restore GPIB defaults.    |
|   1   |    Select function  |   `FUNC “RES”`  |   Select ohms measurement function.   |
|    2  |  Select ohms mode    |    `RES:MODE AUTO`   |  Auto ohms mode.    |
|     3 |   Select range   |  `RES:RANG 20E3`   |   Select 20kΩ range.   |
|      |      |    `:SYST:RSEN ON`  |   Enable 4-wire sensing.   |
|      |      |   `:FORM:ELEM RES`   |   Resistance reading.   |
|  4    | Output on     |  `:OUTP ON`    |  Turn on output.    |
|   5   |   Get reading   |  `:READ?`    |   Trigger and acquire reading.   |
|    6  |   Output off   |   `:OUTP OFF`   |   Turn off output.   |
